## Info

This Generator is built over the old official generator, but this one is NOT official, and is not being maintained by the MCreator Team.

This plugin is intended for generator plugin developers to offer name mappings to work from and offer
examples on how to use Freemarker mechanics and to see what data is available in the templates.
